# covid-19-italy
This repository contains my personal elaboration of the datasets published by the Italian Government about the SARS-CoV-2 Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak.

The code is written in Python wih the use of Numpy/Pandas/Matplotlib libraries, and run on Jupyter Lab. The code can be found in the file 'regional-data.ipynb'

Output graphs are:

* Sper100kP + date : number of Covid-19 tests performed per 100k inhabitants
* Tper100kP + date : number of tested positives per 100k inhabitants

Further information on the methodology used and a discussion on the results can be found on my website https://ducciogasparri.it/2020/03/24/covid-19-italy/
